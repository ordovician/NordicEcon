# Source of Data
This data is obtained from various sources:

- [data.worldbank.org.](https://data.worldbank.org) has stastistics on GDP and expenses as percent of  GDP.
- [OECD.Stat](https://stats.oecd.org) statistics on unions.
- [IMF Datamapper](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper) IMF statistics. Has great system for visualizing data.

You can download in different formats but I chose CSV files as they are easy to work with in Julia. Of all these sources I think OECD has the nicest CSV formats to work with.
