# Source of Data
This data is obtained from the world bank. You can obtain the same data by going to [data.worldbank.org.](https://data.worldbank.org). Just provide the countries at the measurements you are interested in.

You can download in different formats but I chose CSV files as they are easy to work with in Julia.
