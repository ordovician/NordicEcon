This is code used to analyze GDP growth, public spending and other aspects of the Nordic economies. In particular the interest is to look at how Nordic development changed under different governments and world events.

In particular there are a number of events to study here:

- Oil shocks of 1973 and 1979.
- The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and how it caused the largest historical economic collapse for any Western country since 1929 in Finland.
- The Bank crisis in the 1990s in Nordic countries produced from Banking deregulations in the 1980s

## Utility
This is also a useable example in how to use data frames and plotting in Julia beyound toy examples.
